# Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
    - Isaiah: Front-End utility
    - Tim: Team cordination, back-end utility
    - Branden: Javascript logic
    - Jacob: Back-end utility, reaching for help/resources

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
    - Isaiah:
    - Tim:
    - Branden: 
    - Jacob: 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    - Similar to class structure, 9am start, 10am 10min Break, 12pm 1 Hour Break, 4pm 10 min Break.

Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- Stand up
- Communciate what has already been done, and where individuals are backed up and help that aspect
- Have at least one member approve of pull requests, suggestions, individual significant changes

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Communicate and intervene on the matter

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Going over indiviudal progress during the morning, pick up and progress where necessary
- Team split into 2 teams, two on Front-End, two on Back-End. Each sub-team must stay on communication regularly.
- Screensharing when possible would improve visual indications

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Same as the question above

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- Bringing in appropriate authority e.g instructor
- Agreement by vote or other necessary methods

# Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up:

What hours will you be available to communicate?
- Tuesday-Thursday standard 9-5

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack and Remo

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Communicate to team, ask for help, catch up on as much as possible

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Using Slack and Virtual Campus

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- Communciating in a 1 by 1 format

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- Similar to answer above

# Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- Project already split into 2 sub-teams. Front-End is predicted to needing more work so we're adjusting to that as of the beginning of the project prep
- Communicate during working hours and have a reflection towards the end about our indiviudal progress

What project management tool will be used?
- Trello & GitHub Projects

# Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks:

What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- Front-End: Everything but node.modules and .env
- Back-End: Everything but node.modules and .env
- Project Prep (md)

How will you share the repository with your team?
- Organization Repo

What is your Git flow?
- Individual branches (main > dev > individual)

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR?
- One peer reviewing, in addition to the individual requesting it

Who merges PRs?
- One person from front and back, both parties have to communicate as well before confirming
- Test on localhost before all together

How often will you merge?
- Merge at least one a day if significant progress is made

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
- Usually at the end of the day when most project stuff is done and checked
